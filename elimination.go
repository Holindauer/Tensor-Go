// Gaussian Elimination

// Plan for implementing Gaussian Elimination:

// I will need to implement a concat() function that concatenates two tensors along a specified axis.
// This will be used to build out the upper triangular matrix while keeping the original matrix intact.
// I will also need to implement a swap() function that swaps two rows of a matrix for cases where the
// pivot is zero. This will be used to swap rows to avoid dividing by zero.
// I'll also need to figure out some kind of simple equation solver for back substitution.
